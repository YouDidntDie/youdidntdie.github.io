# HOW TO START A FIRE

Fire is warmth. Fire is light. Fire is life.  
Or in your case, fire is the only thing standing between survival and being a popsicle corpse found by squirrels.

## 🔧 YOU'LL NEED:
- Dry tinder (paper, birch bark, tampon, dryer lint)
- Kindling (twigs, small sticks, pine needles)
- Fuel wood (logs, branches)
- Ignition source (lighter, matches, ferro rod, sheer rage)

## 💀 IF YOU HAVE NOTHING:
- Use the **bow drill method**. Hope you did arm day.
- Or spark steel on rock. Prepare to bleed.
- Worst case? Strip wire from a battery and short it on steel wool. Pray.

## 🔥 FIRE-BUILDING STRUCTURES:
- Teepee: Fast and furious.
- Log cabin: Controlled and cozy.
- Lean-to: Wind-resistant.

## ❌ DON'T:
- Use gasoline. This isn’t NASCAR.
- Build under trees.
- Leave it unattended. Smokey will f*** you up.
